Having trouble remembering where you parked you car? 
Fear no more.
The solution is here. If you find yourself forgetting where you parked your car,
download this app, and you will never wonder around again looking for your car.

The app offers and automatic and a manual method to save your car's last parked position.

1) The automatic method.
    If your car has bluetooth you can add it through the app's  "Add 
    bluetooth" option, and then anytime your car disconnects from your phone 
    the car's location will be saved without you doing anything! That's it you no 
   longer need to remember where you parked or to remember to save the 
   car's position.
2) The manual method.
    If your car does not have bluetooth worry not! You can still save the 
    location of your car manually by opening the app and tapping "Save 
   location". The only drawback with the manual method, as opposed to 
    automatic method, is that you need to remember to save the location when 
    you park.
   remember to save it when you park.
